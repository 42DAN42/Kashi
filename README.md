## About Kashi

Kashi is a custom [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) widget that displays the current song lyrics on the Macbook Pro's Touch Bar.

Kashi works with [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/download/other/), [Music](https://www.apple.com/music/), and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com) (Chrome or Safari).

Kashi has three main functions:
1. It retrieves data about the current song playing in Spotify, Music, or YouTube via AppleScript.
2. It calls [Genius](https://docs.genius.com/) and checks for a good match in the search hits, accounting for variations such as remixes.
3. It scrapes the lyrics from the raw HTML of the Genius URL, prettifies, and outputs them onto the Touch Bar.

Regarding YouTube:
1. YouTube must be playing on the active tab on Chrome or Safari, with window focus.
2. If both browser and player are open, Kashi will prioritize the player if it is playing.

Depending on how your Python is installed, the widget may already be working. If not, do Step 4 below to configure the widget's parameters.

### Step 4: Set Widget Parameters

The Launch Path parameter must direct to your Python 3 install. [PATH](https://bic-berkeley.github.io/psych-214-fall-2016/using_pythonpath.html) will also work.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Default - "/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.7/bin/python3.7"

The second parameter must refer to Python's "site-packages" folder containing Python modules.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Default - "/Library/Frameworks/Python.Framework/Versions/3.7/lib/Python3.7/site-packages"

Lyrics for the currently playing song should now appear on the Touch Bar. Enjoy! üéâ
