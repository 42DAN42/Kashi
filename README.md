Kashi is a custom preset for [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) that displays the current song's lyrics on the Macbook Pro's Touch Bar. It works with [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/download/other/) and [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/download/).

Kashi has three main functions:
1. It gets the current song playing via AppleScript.
2. It searches the [Genius API](https://docs.genius.com/) and looks for the best match within the hits.
3. It scrapes lyrics from the raw HTML, formats, and outputs them onto the Touch Bar.
