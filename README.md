Kashi is a custom [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) widget that displays the current song lyrics on the Macbook Pro's Touch Bar.

Kashi currently works with [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/download/other/), [Music](https://www.apple.com/music/), and [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com).

**11.30.19: Updated for macOS Catalina.**

**6.23.19: YouTube support added.**

Kashi will also work when watching a YouTube music video on Chrome or Safari. In order to do this, Youtube must be on the active tab. If a browser and a player are open at the same time, Kashi will prioritize the player if it is playing music.

## How It Works

Kashi has three main functions:
1. It retrieves data about the current song playing in Spotify, Music, or Youtube via AppleScript.
2. It calls [Genius](https://docs.genius.com/) and checks for a good match in the search hits, accounting for variations such as remixes.
3. It scrapes the lyrics from the raw HTML of the Genius URL, prettifies, and outputs them onto the Touch Bar.
